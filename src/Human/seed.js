I thought of it as a rite of passage living in the Silicon Valley for decades. I also volunteered in my community as a youth mentor and tutor at the Boys & Girls Club. I found it deeply rewarding to impact young people in a positive way, so I transitioned into full-time non-profit work focused around tech education and youth development throughout the South Bay Area.
