# Back Log
* Add reveal-on-scroll effect, check out npm package `react-reveal` âœ“
* Landing View is disabled until able to detect route... In case user hits refresh while NOT on the landing view, prevent navbar animation from taking so long.
  * Figure out how to check for current route within `<Main />`, and if it is not `/`, render a different navbar with little to none `duration` props Flip and Fade.
* Improve the browser compatibility issues with React Reveal
* Improve the responsiveness of `<Bits>`.
* Seed the data for projects on `<Bits />` instead of manual input.
* Create transitions between components
* Resolve console errors on `<Pieces>`.
